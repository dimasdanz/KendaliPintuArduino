##  Description
##### Watch the demo on [YouTube] (http://youtu.be/4TFnDXBnQ44)
Door Control is an Arduino based hardware controlled by a web and an Android Application.  
This hardware is used to control a door, and authorize people and record every user who uses the door.  
The Arduino can be enabled/disabled via Android and Web.  
Door can be opened by tapping an NFC-Enabled Android device to a specific nfc tag.  
If the Android does not have nfc support, door can be opened by scanning a specific QR Code.  
There is also a keypad on the hardware for manual password input.  
Every log such as enabling/disabling, people enter or exit will be recorded and will send a notification to Android device.  
To use the Android app, you need to login as user which stored in the database.  
To enable all function of the Android app, you need to login as admin which also stored in the database.  
CRUD operation of user and admin is done via the web.
